Aether: Privacy-First Event Ticketing 🎟️🔒
Aether is a decentralized event ticketing system that keeps your personal data private while ensuring secure ticket verification. No central servers, no data leaks—just seamless and fraud-proof ticketing.

🚀 Why Aether?
✅ Privacy-first – No need to share personal data
✅ Fraud-resistant – Uses cryptographic proofs to verify tickets
✅ Decentralized – No central servers or databases
✅ Fast & Secure – Powered by Mina Protocol’s zero-knowledge technology

🔍 How It Works
1️⃣ Generate – A cryptographic proof confirms your ticket is real
2️⃣ Distribute – Tickets are shared as QR codes with built-in security
3️⃣ Verify – Instant validation without exposing your identity
